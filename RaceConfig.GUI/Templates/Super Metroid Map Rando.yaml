# Q. What is this file?
# A. This file contains options which allow you to configure your multiworld experience while allowing
#    others to play how they want as well.
#
# Q. How do I use it?
# A. The options in this file are weighted. This means the higher number you assign to a value, the
#    more chances you have for that option to be chosen. For example, an option like this:
#
#    map_shuffle:
#      on: 5
#      off: 15
#
#    Means you have 5 chances for map shuffle to occur, and 15 chances for map shuffle to be turned
#    off.
#
# Q. I've never seen a file like this before. What characters am I allowed to use?
# A. This is a .yaml file. You are allowed to use most characters.
#    To test if your yaml is valid or not, you can use this website:
#        http://www.yamllint.com/
#    You can also verify that your Archipelago options are valid at this site:
#        https://archipelago.gg/check

# Your name in-game, limited to 16 characters.
#     {player} will be replaced with the player's slot number.
#     {PLAYER} will be replaced with the player's slot number, if that slot number is greater than 1.
#     {number} will be replaced with the counter value of the name.
#     {NUMBER} will be replaced with the counter value of the name, if the counter value is greater than 1.

    # - Refill stations giving Supers and Power Bombs in addition to Missiles
    # - The auto-save before the escape sequence
    # - Patching out major glitches: Spacetime beam, GT code, and out-of-bounds (death trigger)
    # - Fast decompression (for quicker room loading)
    # - Camera fix when entering Kraid's, Crocomire's, or Spore Spawn's room

  quality_of_life:
    # These options help provide a smoother, more intuitive, and less tedious game experience.
    # Players wanting a full experience of exploration may want to disable some of these options.
    # Three presets are provided:
    # 
    # - Off: All quality-of-life options are turned off. This is for players who want a full experience
    #     of exploration, with a similar feel to the original game. This may involve a lot of wandering around and backtracking 
    #     to figure out where to go. Map stations are harder to find and provide minimal assistance as all item dots look the same.
    # - Low: Many quality-of-life options are turned off, restoring some unintuitive but potentially
    #     interesting vanilla game behavior: some items do not spawn until defeating Phantoon or waking the planet, 
    #     Acid Chozo statue requires Space Jump to use it, and completing the escape may require collecting certain items 
    #     and/or carefully managing energy in the Mother Brain fight. Map stations are somewhat less powerful because all ammo and 
    #     tank items appear as small dots the same as Missiles.
    # - Default: Quality-of-life options are turned to their generally recommended settings (mostly on).
    #     Map stations are very useful, with different item dot shapes to distinguish three tiers of items: Missiles, other 
    #     ammo/tank items, and unique items.
    # - Max: All quality-of-life options are turned on to their highest settings. This includes 
    #     respin, lenient Space Jump, and momentum conservation to more easily control Samus, and an extra-fast Mother Brain fight
    #     that completely skips the second and third phases.
    # - Custom: Uses your specified quality of life options, defaulting to "Default" Quality-of-life values if not specified.

    # - Minibosses: Defeat Spore Spawn, Crocomire, Botwoon, and Golden Torizo.
    # - Metroids: Defeat all the Metroids in the four Metroid rooms.
    # - Chozos: Defeat Bomb Torizo and Golden Torizo, and activate Bowling Alley and Acid Chozo statues.
    #   Note that Phantoon must be defeated before the Bowling Alley statue can be activated.
    # - Pirates: Defeat the enemies in Pit Room, Baby Kraid Room, Plasma Room, and Metal Pirates Room.
    #   Note that Morph and Missiles must be collected before the enemies spawn in Pit Room.

    # should not interfere with how the player executes the fight (including the stand-up glitch).
    # - Short: The fight ends immediately after Mother Brain finishes the first Rainbow Beam attack.
    # - Skip: The fight is skipped entirely.
    # 
    # With the "Short" and "Skip" options, Samus will not get an energy refill before the escape, as the cutscene is 
    # skipped where the refill would normally happen. However, Samus will always collect Hyper Beam.

    # 
    # If this option is disabled, it is possible that the escape may require having collected Reserve Tanks

    # complete the escape fast enough.

    # - Vanilla: Wall jumping behaves like in the vanilla game.
    # - Collectible: A special new "WallJump" item is added to the game (replacing one "Missile" pack), 
    #                 and wall jumping is only possible after collecting this item.
    # 
    # This setting is taken into account in the logic. Selections other than "Vanilla" may significantly increase 
    # the difficulty of the game, by requiring the player to know how to perform many tricks to avoid wall jumping 
    # (using frozen enemies, Speed Booster, Bombs, etc.), depending on the Skill Assumption settings.
    # 
    # Regardless of this setting, it is always possible to get a wall-jump check (the pose that Samus makes when 
    # moving away from a nearby wall), even if pressing jump during the check will not trigger a wall jump.

  etank_refill:
    # This option affects the refill that E-Tanks give when collected:
    # 
    # - Disabled: E-Tanks do not provide an energy refill.
    # - Vanilla: E-Tanks behave as in the vanilla game, refilling regular energy but not reserve energy.
    # - Full: E-Tanks also refill reserves, on top of regular energy.

  maps_revealed:
    # This setting affects to what extent the map is already revealed when starting the game:
    # 
    # - Hidden: Maps are not initially revealed. Map stations must be activated in order to reveal the maps.
    # - Partial: Room outlines and area transitions are shown. Details such as item dots or door locks are 
    #             not shown. Activating map stations will reveal those details.
    # - Revealed: Maps are revealed, as though all the map stations were already activated.

  map_layout:
    # This setting affects how the rooms are arranged on the map:
    # 
    #     - Vanilla: The rooms are arranged as they are in the vanilla game, i.e. there is no map randomization.
    #     - Tame: The rooms are arranged in a random but relatively friendly way: one-ways tend to have short return paths that loop back around.
    #     - Wild: The rooms are arranged in a more random and less friendly way: there will often be one-ways with only long return paths.

  reserve_hud_style:
    # The setting affects how reserve tanks are displayed on the HUD.
    # - Vanilla: A reserve tank indicator is shown on the HUD only if reserve mode is AUTO, and its color indicates whether reserves have any energy or not.
    # - Revamped: Each reserve tank is indicated with a bar showing how full it is. If reserve mode is AUTO, then the AUTO text also appears, 
    #             and its color indicates whether reserves have any energy or not.

  vanilla_screw_attack_animation:
    # This setting determines how the Screw Attack animation appears:
    # - Vanilla: The Screw Attack animation is always based on the Space Jump animation regardless of whether or not Space Jump is equipped.
    # - Split: Screw Attack without Space Jump equipped is based on the spin-jump animation. Screw Attack with Space Jump equipped is based 
    #         on the Space Jump animation.

  palette_theme:
    # This setting controls the palettes for rooms (affecting foregrounds and backgrounds):

    #                 randomized areas to feel more coherent.

  music:
    # This setting determines which music plays in each room:
    # - Vanilla: The same music plays as would in the vanilla game for the given room. On a randomized map this implies that music 
    #             will change across most door transitions, which increases the room load times.
    # - AreaThemed: The music is based on the area that the room belongs to on the randomized map, which can help the areas to feel more coherent.
    # - Disabled: Music is disabled, though sound effects still play.

  shaking:
    # This setting affects the graphical appearance of screen shaking, e.g., during the escape sequence, bosses, and in rooms where lava or acid rises.
