# Q. What is this file?
# A. This file contains options which allow you to configure your multiworld experience while allowing
#    others to play how they want as well.
#
# Q. How do I use it?
# A. The options in this file are weighted. This means the higher number you assign to a value, the
#    more chances you have for that option to be chosen. For example, an option like this:
#
#    map_shuffle:
#      on: 5
#      off: 15
#
#    Means you have 5 chances for map shuffle to occur, and 15 chances for map shuffle to be turned
#    off.
#
# Q. I've never seen a file like this before. What characters am I allowed to use?
# A. This is a .yaml file. You are allowed to use most characters.
#    To test if your yaml is valid or not, you can use this website:
#        http://www.yamllint.com/
#    You can also verify that your Archipelago options are valid at this site:
#        https://archipelago.gg/check

# Your name in-game, limited to 16 characters.
#     {player} will be replaced with the player's slot number.
#     {PLAYER} will be replaced with the player's slot number, if that slot number is greater than 1.
#     {number} will be replaced with the counter value of the name.
#     {NUMBER} will be replaced with the counter value of the name, if the counter value is greater than 1.
name: Player{number}

# Used to describe your yaml. Useful if you have multiple files.

    # - Beat Ganon: teleport to the Room of Rites after beating Onox, then beat Ganon (same as linked game)
    beat_onox: 50
    beat_ganon: 0

  logic_difficulty:
    # The difficulty of the logic used to generate the seed.
    # - Casual: expects you to know what you would know when playing the game for the first time
    # - Medium: expects you to know well the alternatives on how to do basic things, but won't expect any trick
    # - Hard: expects you to know difficult tricks such as bomb jumps

  default_seasons:
    # The world of Holodrum is split in regions, each one having its own default season being forced when entering it.
    # This options gives several ways of manipulating those default seasons.
    # - Vanilla: default seasons for each region are the ones from the original game
    # - Randomized: each region has its own random default season picked at generation time
    # - Random Singularity: a single season is randomly picked and put as default season in every region in the game

  horon_village_season:
    # In the vanilla game, Horon Village default season is chaotic: every time you enter it, it sets a random season.
    # This nullifies every condition where a season is required inside Horon Village, since you can leave and re-enter
    # again and again until you get the season that suits you.
    # - Chaotic: vanilla behavior, which makes logic less interesting inside Horon Village and sometimes expects from
    #   you to leave and re-enter town a dozen times until you get the right season
    # - Normalized: Horon Village behaves like any other region in the game (it has a default season that can be changed
    #   using Rod of Seasons)
    # Setting this option to "Normalized" makes it follow the global behavior defined in "Default Seasons" option

  duplicate_seed_tree:
    # The game contains 6 seed trees but only 5 seed types, which means two trees
    # must contain the same seed type. This option enables choosing which tree will
    # always contain a duplicate of one of the other 5 trees.
    # It is strongly advised to set this to "Tarm Ruins Tree" since it's by far the hardest tree to reach
    # (and being locked out of a useful seed type can lead to very frustrating situations).

    # - Vanilla: Spots contain their golden ore chunk just like in the base game
    # - Shuffled Visible: Spots are randomized, and their tile is replaced with a recognizable "digging spot" tile (like

  fools_ore:
    # In the vanilla game, the Fool's Ore is the item "given" by the strange brothers in "exchange" for your feather.
